   - Example: "AI safety research" → searches for "current AI alignment research", "AI safety regulations 2024", etc.

2. **🔍 Concurrent Information Gathering**
   - Search Agent executes all planned searches simultaneously
   - Each search produces a focused summary
   - Real-time progress updates streamed to UI
   - Failed searches handled gracefully without stopping the process

3. **📊 Intelligent Synthesis**
   - Writer Agent receives all search summaries
   - Creates structured outline for comprehensive coverage
   - Synthesizes findings into cohesive narrative
   - Generates follow-up questions for deeper research

4. **📋 Report Delivery**
   - Final markdown report streamed to web interface
   - Includes executive summary, detailed findings, and recommendations
   - Trace URLs provided for debugging and optimization

### Technical Workflow

```python
# Simplified workflow representation
async def research_workflow(query: str):
    # Step 1: Planning
    plan = await planner_agent.run(query)
    
    # Step 2: Concurrent searches  
    search_tasks = [search_agent.run(search) for search in plan.searches]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*search_tasks)
    
    # Step 3: Synthesis
    report = await writer_agent.run(query, results)
    
    return report
```
